# AlternativeInterface

This idea is to change the way we communicate and how we want to do so. I want to present the following ideas, with the date of when it was thought to be includded in this README.

This idea is mostly changing the current environment for computers. I am thinking that there is a new revolution pending where old tech and new functionalities coexist side-by-side rather than thinking of a linear evolution of technology.

I plan to start the fire of creation where new computers exist with batteries included that can take advantage of fast mobile chips to perform specialized or mundane tasks. The beginning of this would involve a couple of creation of either a linux-based device or custom android kernel/software to take advantage of the desktop mode. 

The hardware creations will be roughly made and would primarily be a combinations of different keyboards, usb-c dongle to connect usb from keyboard and also an hdmi connection from desired video input, and shape of devices. 

The hardware would include an array of central/peripheral devices:

=Central=
1. Mobile device with custom android to feature an adaptable display connectors that would attach to "shell" phones. All of these shell phones would be a peripheral attachment to the mobile device that would instantly load the skin/layout/settings from the main screenless device. 
2. Custom mini computer with batteries that can do the same thing and the devices would display a custom desktop or simplified os skin depending on the type of device they choose, this build would include a small 1-hour battery and the rest of the peripheral devices would allow the addition of extra battery space that should adjust with the custom kernel/android build.

=Peripheral=
1. Pre-2000s tech-revival bundles inspired by Blackberry, Sony VAIO P, QWERTY Slider Phones.
- The basic functions of these devices is to provide a form of alternative input to the common touch screen, keyboard, and other functions. 
- This type of brain-body device allows for users to handle their data personally and limit creation of new devices every year to keep up with demand. E-waste is on the rise, and being able to detach from the device to instantly keep on moving with your life seems like a reasonable choice. 
- Functions included in newer phones like tap-to-pay could still be accessed from a retro-style "ShellPhone". Such example would be the cellphone variant of the central devices to be connected to a Motorola RAZR-style shell that includes a simulation of the retro software and added options to account for modern life. This allows older folk to feel comfortable with using their favorite tech, while still being able to bring up their digital wallet with the tickets to a movie.
- The central device could be enclosed or connected on the back of the devices.
2. All modern tech reused as computers.
- With computers getting smaller and phones getting bigger, there would be the creation of a "goldilocks" section between them. This is the Desktop environment. It seems that the creation of this plane allows users to quickly compare ideas and see more things on the screen to where it seems like a familiar map. 
- While the initial phase would include taking advantage of the usb-c era to simplify most things, this will eventually lead into being able to connect everything through a different port. This would be a re-mapped connection that would the same speed but different application methods.
3. Gaming, connect to your favorite computer or phone using peripheral devices that could be cost-efficient and to each person's liking.
- Retro gamers could connect with gaming peripherals that have screens, and could adopt any form factor they desire. The whole concept is to make the shells as replaceable as possible in order to be able to refurbish them and have the central device be one that would be protected. 
- While this is the initial idea, many trades, professions, and hobbyists will see this as the opportunity for them to become creators as well. This will push someone to request a device to code more comfortably or simply enjoy typing on the go without the compromise of bringing a computer bigger than a notebook everywhere you go. 

=Software Ideas=
1. JoyStick Keyboard - Mapping movements and clicks to form words for those who want to type on keyboards but cannot for any reason. This allows many people to type again and be able to create with lesser limitations.
2. MiniSkins - application skins that would allow the phone to function in the boundaries of the software it is pointed to. Thinking about it like a launcher, and is the foundation of the retro-style software skins that would bring back older variants of interfaces.
3. ReSizeInput - Curiosity of being able to display screen within new boundaries like a frame. Samsung's Flex mode is very limited and being able to code some virtual inputs into the device image boundary much like flex would give insight on the different inputs that could be created to interact with devices.

This is all I have as an idea for this AlernativeInterface section. I do plan on using the concept to create an Android keyboard and then focus on being able to expand it for those with limited mobility. The idea is to be able to connect controllers into the program and allow faster input without the possible unintended screen taps on the mobile program.
